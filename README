Android-AP-Mapper is a Python utility that runs under android-scripting (http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/).  Included are several other scripts to manipulate the generated output.

This was a project assigned by Sebastien Goasguen (Clemson University) in the Fall semester of 2011.

Directions:
1) Start android app
2) Click start/stop button to start the scan
3) Proceed to scan the desired area
4) Periodically check the phone to make sure the script is still running
5) When finished, click the start/stop toggle button again to stop the scan
6) Click the exit button to return to the command line screen to check for any errors
7) Extract log file from the phone
8) Run VerifyLog.py to check for any issues
9) Run logToDic.py to generate dictionary
10) Run one of the KML conversion scripts to get your map
11) Host the map or open it with Google Earth

Files:
apStats.py        -> generate statistics from dictionary file, flags to filter out guest networks / tigernet
gpsDatToKML.py    -> generate KML file from dictionary file
logToDic.py       -> generate dictionary from android script's log file, handles duplicates
verifyLog.py      -> checks for errors in log file and removes offending lines
wepKML.py         -> generate KML file for WEP only
wpa2KML.py        -> generate KML file for WPA2 only
wpaKML.py         -> generate KML file for WPA only

androidTest.py    -> main file for Android app
testing.html      -> GUI for app
